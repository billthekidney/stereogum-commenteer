# stereogum-commenteer
Build a concise list of one's comments and replies for stereogum.com article page.

This extension is intended to be used for article pages with comments
on the stereogum.com web site. Its main inspiration is specifically
from the "The Number Ones" columns, which usually inspire its readers
to leave more than 300 comments on a typical day. But it can be used
for the other parts of stereogum.com.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to https://github.com/billthekidney/stereogum-commenteer/issues
